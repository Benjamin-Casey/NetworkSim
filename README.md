# Todo

- ~~Separate out classes into different files + fix their argument typing. i.e, Port -> port.py, parent_device:Device, link:Link~~
- Give devices uplink ports
- If a switch has an uplink port, ask it's headend for its mac learning table

- ~~Switches need to take note of which port a packet is coming through~~
